&lt;p&gt;So I seem to have gotten the Pelican Blog functioning as directed by Bob from PyBites. It may be a little more convoluted than other blog systems I've utilised previously but it is definitely a way to start using a pythonistic system and get a feel for how something can be done differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this blog will provide some insight into my communication capability to get any further improvements suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also built a development environment to continue my Python Developer Mindset coaching to help standardise and create less focus on setting something up. It contains the following configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debian 10 prebuilt virtual server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.7.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;venv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ssh keys for git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to use venv over pyenv. I've utilised both and thought I'd try venv to keep the python code for each project isolated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think a good addition that could be useful to the initial instructions in setting a project like this up, would be to point people to use requirement.txt files when making projects initially. I've found them very useful for keeping packaging information readily available for when I clone a repository to a new system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
