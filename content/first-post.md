# So Let's Start Here

So I seem to have gotten the Pelican Blog functioning as directed by Bob from PyBites. It may be a little more convoluted than other blog systems I've utilised previously but it is definitely a way to start using a pythonistic system and get a feel for how something can be done differently.

Hopefully this blog will provide some insight into my communication capability to get any further improvements suggested.

I also built a development environment to continue my Python Developer Mindset coaching to help standardise and create less focus on setting something up. It contains the following configuration:

* Debian 10 prebuilt virtual server
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.7.3
* venv
* git
* ssh keys for git

I chose to use venv over pyenv. I've utilised both and thought I'd try venv to keep the python code for each project isolated from each other.

I also think a good addition that could be useful to the initial instructions in setting a project like this up, would be to point people to use requirement.txt files when making projects initially. I've found them very useful for keeping packaging information readily available for when I clone a repository to a new system.
